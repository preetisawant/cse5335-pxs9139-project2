<h4>What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?</h4>
The ruby on rails part was comparatively easy as there are so many available bundles and useful pre-defined modules. Also, the git hub push and heroku part was easy.

<h4>What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?</h4>
The intergration part was difficult. Also, i had difficulty understanding the AJAX calling and mongodb integration in the project. Moreover, the animation part was comparatively difficult.

<h4>If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?</h4>
If i were to use these technologies professionally, then my biggest concern would have been of assuraing that all the team members are comforable with all the programming languages and are at the same skill level. The training part can take time, if not already well versed in the language. Moreover, we cannot predict the term till which these languages are in use. Constant introduction of new languages can lead to problem.
